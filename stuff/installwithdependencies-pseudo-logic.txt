Goal: Using the DevHub's dependency API (https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_dev2gp_extract_dependency_info.htm)
    allow the user to install a package version (package and version number defined by command line arguments) to a scratch/sandbox org
    and it will also find the dependencies for this package version and install those to the org as well.  the command needs to check
    the org first to see if it already contains the package version or one of its dependencies.  If that is the case, then it should simply
    move on to next package to install
